## What did I learn

I am starting to understand how divs work better and better.
I kinda struggled to wrap my head around, for example, the
annual plan card and how to set the position of each element
correctly, but it all worked out in the end. The "hardest"
thing was adding a background image which took me hours to realize that it only needed 2 lines of code and nothing more complicated. I also refined my usage of flexbox and hovers. looking forward to more challenges.
